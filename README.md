# Custom-AI-Tool-for-Gender-Classification-from-Name-Lists
create a simple yet effective AI tool. I have an Excel file containing several thousand rows with first names, last names, and email addresses. Here's what I need:

Requirements:
The AI tool should analyze the first name column and add a new column indicating gender:
"Male" for male names.
"Female" for female names.
"Unknown" if the AI is uncertain or the name is unisex.
The tool should be user-friendly and automatically update the gender column whenever the Excel file is updated. Ideally, this tool would allow me to upload the updated Excel file and return a new file with the gender column filled in.
The AI model should be trained on or capable of working with a wide variety of international names.
If possible, Iâ€™d prefer a custom GPT-based solution or similar, as it would allow for better accuracy and future customization.
The output should be delivered as an updated Excel file.

To build an AI tool that analyzes the gender based on first names in an Excel file, we can leverage Python along with a few libraries to make the process straightforward and automated. Here's how you can achieve this:
Steps:

    Input/Output Format:
        Input: An Excel file with columns for first name, last name, and email.
        Output: A new Excel file with an added column indicating gender for each first name.

    Approach:
        We will use a pre-trained model or API like the Genderize.io API (a free and popular service for gender prediction based on first names). Alternatively, we can use nltk or other open-source libraries that contain datasets for names to predict the gender.
        The AI model will predict the gender for each first name and categorize it as "Male", "Female", or "Unknown" for unisex or uncertain names.

    Libraries:
        pandas: For handling Excel files.
        genderize: To predict the gender based on first name.
        openpyxl: For reading and writing Excel files.

Python Code:

import pandas as pd
import requests
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Function to fetch gender prediction from the Genderize API
def get_gender(name):
    url = f"https://api.genderize.io?name={name}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    
    # Check if the API response has a gender prediction
    if data and 'gender' in data:
        gender = data['gender']
        if gender in ['male', 'female']:
            return gender.capitalize()  # Male or Female
    return 'Unknown'  # Return 'Unknown' if no prediction

# Function to process the Excel file and add the gender column
def process_excel(file_path):
    # Load the Excel file
    df = pd.read_excel(file_path)

    # Check if 'First Name' column exists
    if 'First Name' not in df.columns:
        print("No 'First Name' column found in the file!")
        return

    # Create a new column for gender prediction
    df['Gender'] = df['First Name'].apply(lambda x: get_gender(str(x)))

    # Save the updated DataFrame to a new Excel file
    output_file = file_path.replace('.xlsx', '_with_gender.xlsx')
    df.to_excel(output_file, index=False)
    print(f"Gender prediction added and saved to {output_file}")

# Example usage
file_path = 'your_excel_file.xlsx'  # Replace with your actual file path
process_excel(file_path)

How It Works:

    get_gender Function:
        Uses the Genderize.io API to get the predicted gender based on the first name.
        If the name is recognizable as male or female, it returns "Male" or "Female". If it's uncertain or unisex, it returns "Unknown".

    process_excel Function:
        Reads the Excel file with pandas.
        Checks for the "First Name" column and then applies the gender prediction function to each first name.
        Writes the updated DataFrame to a new Excel file, adding the "Gender" column.

    API Integration:
        The get_gender function sends a request to the Genderize API for each name and processes the response.

    Output:
        The tool outputs a new Excel file with the added "Gender" column.

Dependencies:

You need to install the following Python libraries if they are not already installed:

pip install pandas requests openpyxl

Example Flow:

    Input File: The input Excel file (your_excel_file.xlsx) should have columns like:
    First Name	Last Name	Email
    John	Doe	john@example.com
    Emma	Smith	emma@example.com

    Output File: The output file will look like:
    First Name	Last Name	Email	Gender
    John	Doe	john@example.com	Male
    Emma	Smith	emma@example.com	Female

    Automation: The function can be easily scheduled or integrated into a system to monitor changes in an Excel file and update the gender column automatically.

Customization:

    Handling Unisex Names: Gender prediction models can often return "Unknown" for names that are common across genders (like "Alex" or "Jordan"). You can tweak the get_gender function to flag these cases with additional logic or even build your own custom dataset for better accuracy.
    International Names: Genderize API supports multiple languages, but it is important to note that there may still be edge cases. You could expand the functionality by integrating additional name databases or training a custom model if needed.

This solution should give you a user-friendly, efficient AI tool to predict and categorize genders based on first names in an Excel file.
